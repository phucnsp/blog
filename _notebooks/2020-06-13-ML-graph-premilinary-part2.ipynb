    "Up to now, we have only considered $K_1$ initiator matrices with binary values $\\{0,1\\}$. However, such graphs generated from such initiator matrices have \"staircase\" effects in the degree distributions and individual values occur very frequently because of the discrete nature of $K_1$.    \n",
    "To negate this effect, stochasticity is introduced by relaxing the assumption that the entries in the initiator matrix can only take binary values. Instead entries in $\\Theta_1$ can take values on the interval $[0, 1]$, and each represents the probability of that particular edge appearing. Then the matrix (and all the generated larger matrix products) represents the probability distribution over all possible graphs from that matrix.\n",
