I have been working as Data Scientist at MTI Technology Vietnam since 2018 and my journey in AI field started since 2017.   
In here, I mainly work with OCR (optical charcter recognition) projects where we not only have to extract texts from documents
but also classify it into some specific fields defined by clients.
